- When I click cmd + t in explorer in vscode, I wanna move to editor1 and open a new tab
- When I do "git pull origin default branch", I see a file. I don't wanna see it when it doesn't fail
```
From https://github.com/sorajima-studio/soracomi
 * branch              main       -> FETCH_HEAD
Auto-merging admin/app/routes/comics/route.tsx
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in admin/app/routes/comics/route.tsx
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```
