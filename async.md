Async logics don't prevent successor logics.

# What is the async function.

In a nutshell, async function is a function which returns Promise object.
Promise object includes then, catch and finally property.
We can add some handlings to the each property(then, catch and finally) after the function returns Promise object.
The handlings tend to be a success or error handling.
